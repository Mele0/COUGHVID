# ML Project on the COUGHVID dataset

cough.ipynb script: This is the script for preprocessing metadata. Within the script, we recode variables and NA values, scale numeric values, one hot encode catagorical variables and run kNN imputation for missing values. We also remove individuals who 1) dont have their cough analysed by a physician and 2) whose gender = 'other'. Following this preprocessing script, exploratory data anlysis and a table1 should be carried out on our final participants.
